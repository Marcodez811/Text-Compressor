# This project uses Huffman coding to achive efficient lossless file compression.
Will update more information in this readme. (2024.08.15)
Currently only offers the support of compression.
Will enable option for decompression or even develop a GUI app if free.

```bash
# To run this project, input the following:
./build.sh # to build the project from source
./main filename # to compress the given file
```
The 'compressed' file will then be placed into the '/output' folder.
